  The Terraform plugin for RisingWave Cloud https://cloud.risingwave.com/ allows you to manage your resources
  on the RisingWave Cloud platform with Terraform.
  This project is under heavy development. Please join our
  Slack https://join.slack.com/t/risingwave-community/shared_invite/zt-1jei7dk79-fguGadPI2KnhtWnnxBVGoA to get the latest information.
  Authentication
  Before using the provider, you need to create an API key and API secret at the RisingWave Cloud portal.
  Please check the
  documentation https://docs.risingwave.com/cloud/service-account for more information.
  Note that you can also use environment variables to set the API key and API secret:
  hcl
  RWC_API_KEY=myapikeyvalue
  RWC_API_SECRET=myapisecretvalue
  
  This allows you to manage your credentials in a more secure way.
  Quick Start
  ```hcl
  Install Terraform provider for RisingWave Cloud
  terraform {
      required_providers {
        risingwavecloud = {
            source = "risingwavelabs/risingwavecloud"
            version =
        }
      }
  }
  Configure the RisingWave Cloud provider
  provider "risingwavecloud" {
      apikey    =     # or use RWCAPIKEY environment variable
      apisecret =  # or use RWCAPISECRET environment variable
  }
  Create a RisingWave Cluster
  resource "risingwavecloudcluster" "mycluster" {
    name    = "mycluster"
    version = "v1.7.1"
    region  = "us-east-1"
    spec = {
      risingwaveconfig = ""
      compute = {
        defaultnodegroup = {
          cpu    = "0.5"
          memory = "2 GB"
        }
      }
      compactor = {
        defaultnodegroup = {
          cpu    = "1"
          memory = "4 GB"
        }
      }
      meta = {
        defaultnodegroup = {
          cpu    = "0.5"
          memory = "2 GB"
        }
        etcdmetastore = {
          defaultnodegroup = {
            cpu    = "0.5"
            memory = "2 GB"
          }
        }
      }
      frontend = {
        defaultnodegroup = {
          cpu    = "0.5"
          memory = "2 GB"
        }
      }
    }
  }```
  Import Resources
  You can import existing resources into Terraform using the terraform import command.
  To import a resource, you need to know the resource ID to let the provider know which resource to fetch from
  the RisingWave Cloud platform. Read the documentation of each resource to know how to get its ID.
  For more details about this command, check the Terraform documentation https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import.

# risingwavecloud Provider

The Terraform plugin for [RisingWave Cloud](https://cloud.risingwave.com/) allows you to manage your resources 
on the RisingWave Cloud platform with Terraform.

**This project is under heavy development. Please join our 
[Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/risingwave-community/shared_invite/zt-1jei7dk79-fguGadPI2KnhtWnnxBVGoA) to get the latest information.**


## Authentication
Before using the provider, you need to create an API key and API secret at the RisingWave Cloud portal.
Please check the 
[documentation](https://docs.risingwave.com/cloud/service-account) for more information.

Note that you can also use environment variables to set the API key and API secret:
```hcl
RWC_API_KEY=myapikeyvalue
RWC_API_SECRET=myapisecretvalue
```
This allows you to manage your credentials in a more secure way.


## Quick Start

```hcl
# Install Terraform provider for RisingWave Cloud
terraform {
	required_providers {
	  risingwavecloud = {
		  source = "risingwavelabs/risingwavecloud"
		  version = <provider version>
	  }
	}
}

# Configure the RisingWave Cloud provider
provider "risingwavecloud" {
	api_key    = <API Key>    # or use RWC_API_KEY environment variable
	api_secret = <API Secret> # or use RWC_API_SECRET environment variable
}

# Create a RisingWave Cluster
resource "risingwavecloud_cluster" "mycluster" {
  name    = "mycluster"
  version = "v1.7.1"
  region  = "us-east-1"
  spec = {
    risingwave_config = ""
    compute = {
      default_node_group = {
        cpu    = "0.5"
        memory = "2 GB"
      }
    }
    compactor = {
      default_node_group = {
        cpu    = "1"
        memory = "4 GB"
      }
    }
    meta = {
      default_node_group = {
        cpu    = "0.5"
        memory = "2 GB"
      }
      etcd_meta_store = {
        default_node_group = {
          cpu    = "0.5"
          memory = "2 GB"
        }
      }
    }
    frontend = {
      default_node_group = {
        cpu    = "0.5"
        memory = "2 GB"
      }
    }
  }
}  
```


## Import Resources
You can import existing resources into Terraform using the `terraform import` command. 

To import a resource, you need to know the resource ID to let the provider know which resource to fetch from 
the RisingWave Cloud platform. Read the documentation of each resource to know how to get its ID.
