  Import a Privatelink Resource
  To import a Privatelink resource, follow the steps below:
  
  Get the UUID of the privatelink from the RisingWave Cloud platform.
  Write a resource definition to import the cluster. For example:
  
    resource "risingwavecloud_privatelink" "test" {
      depends_on = [risingwavecloud_cluster.mycluster]
  
      cluster_id      = "cluster-id"
      connection_name = "test-connection"
      target          = "test-target"
    }
  
  ~> Note: When destroying all resources, make sure the Terraform be aware of the dependency between the cluster and the
  private link resource. If the cluster is deleted before the private link resource, the deletion of the private link resource
  will fail. You can either use the depends_on argument or use the output of the cluster to create the
  private link resource.
  Run the import command:
  
  terraform import risingwavecloud_privatelink.test <privatelink_id>

# risingwavecloud_privatelink (Resource)

A Private Link connection on the RisingWave Cloud platform.

In AWS, it is a configured endpoint to connect to a VPC endpoint service in your VPC.

In GCP, it is a endpoint to a service attachment in your private network.

Learn more details about this resource at [RisingWave Cloud Documentation](https://docs.risingwave.com/cloud/create-a-connection/).

## Import a Privatelink Resource

To import a Privatelink resource, follow the steps below:

1. Get the UUID of the privatelink from the RisingWave Cloud platform.

2. Write a resource definition to import the cluster. For example:

```hcl
  resource "risingwavecloud_privatelink" "test" {
    depends_on = [risingwavecloud_cluster.mycluster]

    cluster_id      = "cluster-id"
    connection_name = "test-connection"
    target          = "test-target"
  }
  ```

  ~> **Note:** When destroying all resources, make sure the Terraform be aware of the dependency between the cluster and the 
  private link resource. If the cluster is deleted before the private link resource, the deletion of the private link resource 
  will fail. You can either use the `depends_on` argument or use the output of the cluster to create the 
  private link resource.

3. Run the import command:

```shell
terraform import risingwavecloud_privatelink.test <privatelink_id>
```

## Schema

### Required

- `cluster_id` (String) The NsID (namespace id) of the cluster in format of UUID.
- `connection_name` (String) The name of the Private Link connection, just for display purpose.
- `target` (String) The target of the Private Link connection. In AWS, it is the service name of the VPC endpoint service. In GCP, it is the service attachment in Private Service Connect.

### Optional

- `wait_for_ready` (Boolean) Whether to wait for the private link to be ready after creation. Default is false.

### Read-Only

- `endpoint` (String) The endpoint of the Private Link to connect to. This has different format for different platforms.
- `id` (String) The global identifier for the resource in format of UUID.
